Welcome to the Monte Carlo Simulation CLI Tool repository! This project is a collection of code I‚Äôve written over the years to simplify project forecasting using monte carlo simulations. Initially inspired by a presentation from Dimitar Bakardzhiev and fueled by the work of Daniel Vacanti and Prateek Singh, I‚Äôve moved away from Excel-based simulations to Python for greater flexibility and scalability.
## üöÄ Features

    Flexible Simulations: Run Monte Carlo simulations to forecast project timelines.
    Command-line Interface (CLI): Easily interact with the tool via the command line.
    Customizable Parameters: Modify key parameters to fit the specific needs of your project.
    Real-world Tested: This tool has been applied in real-life project management scenarios.


## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.7 or higher
    pip

## Installation

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/nlovadina/montecarlocli.git`

Prepare a python virtual environment:

`$ python3 -m venv montecarlocli`

Navigate to the project directory:

`$ cd montecarlocli`

Activate the environment

`$ . ./bin/activate`

Finally install it with pip, all the dependencies will be automatically downloaded:

`$ pip install --editable .`

And last step: 
`$ montecarlocli --help`

Have fun.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings 

The code needs desperatly some adjustement, cleanup and improvement because I literally took various script and put them togheter in a file.
Before using the simulation I reccomand watching the following video on youtube:

Because there is no silver bullet.

## Version history

1. V 0.1 **07/10/2024 First release of the code**
2. V 0.2 **12/10/2024 Better command line.** The two simulation has been logically separated and some more options have been added read the internal help
3. v 0.3 **13/10/2024 Multiple percentiles.** Added option to have multiple percentiles and removed dependency on colorama.
