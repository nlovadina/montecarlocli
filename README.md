#Monte Carlo Simulation CLI Tool

Welcome to the Monte Carlo Simulation CLI Tool repository! This project is a collection of code I‚Äôve written over the years to simplify project forecasting using Monte Carlo simulations. Initially inspired by a presentation from Dimitar Bakardzhiev, I‚Äôve since refined and enhanced it, moving away from Excel-based simulations to Python for greater flexibility and scalability.
## üöÄ Features

    Flexible Simulations: Run Monte Carlo simulations to forecast project timelines.
    Command-line Interface (CLI): Easily interact with the tool via the command line.
    Customizable Parameters: Modify key parameters to fit the specific needs of your project 
    Real-world Tested: This tool has been applied in real-life project management scenarios.


## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.7 or higher
    pip

## Installation

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/nlovadina/montecarlocli.git`
Prepare a python virtual environment:
`$ python3 -m venv montecarlocli`
Navigate to the project directory:
`$ cd montecarlocli`
Activate the environment
`$ ./bin/activate`
Finally install it with pip:
`$ pip install --editable .`
And finally 
`$ montecarlocli --help`

Have fun.
